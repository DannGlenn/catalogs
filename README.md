## Notes

It's highly recommended to download `SQLite3 Editor` extension to view /database.db (contraints, triggers and data structure)

Was written as a sample with support for 1 customer, additional customers support would exceed the scope of the task

Visual design was kept to a minimum since no UI design file was provided
